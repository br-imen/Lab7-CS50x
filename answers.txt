If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize
their audio aura?

 When executing query: SELECT AVG(energu) , AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) from songs;
I found that highest value was 0.72 in danceability and 0.66 in energy so I think that their audio aura has
a deep and a rapid dancing rythme.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this
aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I think that if we calculate every month the average not the whole year. because our mood changes
and our needs changes, our goals.. from day to day, so within the year isn't really representive of the listener.
